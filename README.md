# Painting with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Our project aims to revolutionize fisheries management through advanced data visualization tools, facilitating informed decision-making and sustainable resource management practices.


## Background

Problems Addressed:

1. Data Accessibility: Current tools often lack accessibility for diverse fisheries data sources, hindering comprehensive analysis.
2. Integration Challenges: Difficulty in integrating data from various sources leads to inefficiencies in decision-making processes.
3. Transparency Issues: Limited transparency in how fisheries management decisions are made can lead to distrust and inefficiencies in resource allocation.
   
Frequency and Importance:

These challenges are widespread globally, affecting not only environmental sustainability but also economic stability and food security. Improving data access and transparency is crucial for effective fisheries management, ensuring the long-term viability of marine resources.

Personal Motivation:
Our team is driven by a passion for environmental conservation and a commitment to leveraging technology for societal benefit. We believe that accessible and transparent data analytics can empower stakeholders to make informed decisions that promote both ecological health and economic prosperity.

## How is it used?

Usage Scenarios:
Users, including environmental agencies, researchers, and policymakers, can upload fisheries data to our platform. The system then processes this data to generate interactive visualizations and analytics. These tools aid in:

1. Real-time Decision-making: Providing up-to-date insights into fish stocks and environmental conditions.
2. Policy Formulation: Supporting evidence-based policy decisions for sustainable fisheries management.
3. Community Engagement: Enhancing transparency and fostering trust among stakeholders.
   
Environmental Considerations:
Our solution is adaptable across different environmental contexts, from local fishing communities to national regulatory bodies. It supports efforts to balance conservation with socio-economic needs, promoting responsible fishing practices.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

Limitations:
While our project enhances data accessibility and transparency, it does not directly address broader issues such as illegal fishing or geopolitical fisheries conflicts. These systemic challenges require multi-faceted approaches involving international cooperation and policy reform.

Ethical Considerations:
Key ethical considerations include:

Data Privacy: Ensuring confidentiality and security of sensitive fisheries data.
Bias in AI: Mitigating biases in AI algorithms to ensure fair and accurate decision support.
Environmental Impact: Striving for a net positive environmental impact through responsible technology deployment.

## What next?

Future Development:
Future iterations of our project could explore:

Real-time Data Integration: Incorporating real-time data streams for more dynamic decision support.
Enhanced AI Capabilities: Advancing AI models for more accurate predictive modeling and scenario analysis.
Community Engagement Tools: Developing features to facilitate stakeholder collaboration and feedback.

Skill and Support Needs:
To achieve these goals, we seek expertise in marine biology, AI development, and partnerships with environmental NGOs and governmental agencies. Collaborative efforts are essential to scaling our solution effectively and maximizing its impact on sustainable fisheries management.
